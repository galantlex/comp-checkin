# Comp CheckIn
This creatively named app uses the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, NodeJS) stack to implement a simple and easy to use webapp to help dancers check in at ballroom competitions. Hopefully, it will be completed and ready to use at Tufts Competition 2017, on November 12th.

# To Run
You'll first need Mongo and Node installed in your environment. Then simply clone this repo, run `npm install`, and then `npm run start-dev`, I think. I know these are not good instructions for newbies; I'll come back and make this better when I understand it better myself, honestly.

# Contributing
This isn't really an open source project with a community, as it's just not that big an app, but please do check out current open issues and suggest changes if you can fix them! I would so appreciate any help you are willing to lend =] Submit a PR or comment on the issue whenever, and I'll take a look. Thank you!
